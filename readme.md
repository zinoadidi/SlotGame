## slot game was wriiten in JS ES6

App.js serves as entry point.

js folder contains the source code for app.js and other js files
vue js is used for data binding and jquery for dom manipulation

It is best to run code on any server available 
or using ide like webstorm to lunch the html file in browser
code can also be run by clicking the index.html file

code is tested with latest version of chrome

## Note:
- animation on the reel itself is the only item not submitted that isn't activated at submission time because it was commented out; i activated it after and committed the update.
- Everything is designed to best understanding of the requirement pdf file i have included

# Known Issue
- There can be some updates in updating the UI during spinning. 
There are other options i have tried as regards spinning and other options i get to try
